#Appropriate Approaches to Online Community
The original booklet is [here](http://www.popomo.com/research/blog/?p=842)##Introduction
This guide considers the development of **online community networks** from the perspective of community arts practitioners. It explores multiple aspects of making networks, to help practitioners develop **appropriate internet practices** – network solutions that take the specific needs of individuals and communities in to consideration. The guide promotes **critical approaches** to online community building, to encourage the continuation of creative practices beyond community arts projects.The following 6 considerations will hopefully help you navigate the process of developing online community. Regardless of what type of online network you want to nurture, the guide will provide some food for thought regarding the most appropriate solution for your project.

###1. Longevity: the network's shelf life
Although it’s difficult to know how long your network might flourish, estimating how long it will remain in use is something to consider. The proposed life span of the network will help determine suitable technological solutions, based on such things as software stability and ongoing costs.
Understanding the social implications of both temporary and ongoing networks is also important. In some situations, there will be a minimal impact if a network is there one day and gone the next; but in others, this might affect whether the project has a lasting impact.
Practitioners should also bear in mind that network participation will ebb and flow. In other words, participants will bail out of the network, so consider it an acceptable form of action to plan for (Lovink 2005, p12).
**An example might be:**
Community artist Fatima is about to lead a Scratch project with a group of 14 year old girls (Scratch is a programming language that makes it easy to create interactive media). Fatima wants there to be an online community aspect to the project so the girls can share the media they make, then rate and comment on their peers’ work. Fatima decides to use the existing Scratch online community for her project, as she feels the girls have a level of creative agency that will enable them to become involved in a wider media sharing network. She is aware this ‘community’ might be temporary, but is confident this will not have a negative impact on the individuals involved.
**Questions to ask yourself:**
1. What are the reasons for making the network temporary/ongoing? 
2. How stable do I need in the networking technologies to be? How do I measure this?3. How can I manage my own expectations of participation levels?
---###2. Interoperability: whether the network ‘talks’ to other relevant software
Interoperability describes the ability to interface with, or ‘talk to’ software and hardware. If two things are interoperable, the lines of communication are open and flowing. Like most things, this process can be perceived as having potential benefits (innovation and competition); as well as potential drawbacks (security and accountability) (Gasser and Palfrey 2007).
Interoperability becomes a big issue for community artists when projects require the use of several ‘free’ software services that need to communicate with each other.The idea extends beyond technical communication, to describe solutions that make creative content interoperable – for example, whether the network offers Creative Commons licensing for content uploads and remixing.
**An example might be:**
Community artist Waleed is about to lead a locative media project with a group of refugees. The creative output of the project utilises a smart phone augmented reality app to display remixed music videos. Waleed’s challenge is to find an app that will run on all the major mobile platforms, that ‘talks to’ free mapping software. If Waleed is unsuccessful, he can elist outside help, or shift the scope of the project.
**Questions to ask yourself:**1. Will the project benefit from choosing network technologies that offer interoperable protocols and formats?2. How can I plan for interoperability issues that might arise?3. Does the network allow creative content to become interoperable?
---###3. Usability: the experience of the user
The needs and potential desires of the user must be considered when devising community networks online. A balance must be struck between choosing technologies they can use, and technologies they can learn to use. Some people will be agile learners, others will have difficulty incorporating new technologies in to their lives and creative processes.
A good way to assess usability is through developing an understanding of your participants’ “communicative ecology” – the various devices and applications they already use to communicate (Hearn and Foth 2007).
By developing a picture of existing technologies, practitioners are less likely to make assumptions about what people are using, how they are using it, and what they might want to use.
**An example might be:**

Community artist Jove is about to lead a digital animation project with a group of young men. She wants to develop a temporary online community as part of the project, so the men can share their work with each other. After conducting some activities with the group about the ways they use the Internet, she realises that participation in the online community will mostly happen via mobile phones. She then goes about trying to understand what the implications of this method of participation will be.
**Questions to ask yourself:**
1. What kinds of technology do my participants have access to?2. How might my participants want to be involved in the network?3. What other kinds of tools and technology might this particular group respond to?
---###4. Hackability: whether the network can be modified
Hacking, or modding (modifying) can be thought of as a form of DIY intervention that aims to subvert designed systems. It is a method of traversing digital technologies that allows users to manipulate tools beyond the original intention of the designer.Modding practices are well suited to community arts and informal education as they encourage practitioners to overcome the limitations of software platforms, innovating in subtle ways.The wonderful thing about the hacking process in relation to the Internet is that it brings “political questions back in to the light, subverting closed and hidden functions and uses of networks” (Von Busch and Palmas 2006).
**An example might be:**
Community artist Sonny, is about to lead a digital photo sharing project with a group of teenagers. Sonny decides to use Flickr to develop a community online, as their open API (application programming interface), allows for accessible, legal modding of their photo sharing service. As Sonny develops the project with the group, he scours the already available software hacks. He and the group decide that in order for their ideas to be realised, further hacking of the Flickr API must occur. No-one in the group has the software programming skills to do this, so they employ a computer science student from a nearby university to make it for them.
**Questions to ask yourself:**
1. How might I mod the technology with my existing skills?2. How might I mod the technology through research and experimentation? 
3. How might I collaborate with others to mod the technology?
---###5. Invisibility: the less visible implications of use
Digital communications networks can be described as consisting of seven layers: the physical layer, link layer, network layer, transport layer, session layer, presentation layer, and application layer. Most Internet users are only conscious of the application layer, as this is the part of the network infrastructure that is most visible to them e.g. software interfaces.
Multiple human and non-human actors affect your network use in those other 6 layers. These include software protocols, government policies, and private companies who own the submarine cables that carry network traffic.
When designing and making your network, think about how the structures and dynamics of these various levels of network infrastructure might affect your project and your participants.

**An example might be:**

Community artist Kim is about to lead a digital storytelling project with an LGBT group. Some of the participants do not want their sexual orientation or gender reassignment to be made public, but they do want to share their stories online. Kim is aware that many commercial media sharing platforms sell information to third party advertisers who create user profiles associated with computer IP (internet protocol) addresses. This can lead to targeted Internet advertising that has the potential to reveal sensitive inofrmation. Kim decides to use a WordPress installation on her own server, to allay concerns her participants might have regarding such practices.
**Questions to ask yourself:**
1. How might I describe who or what controls the network technology?2. Does my project suit the terms and conditions the technology specifies? 
3. Am I compromising my own, or my participants’ security or privacy by choosing a commercial or proprietary networking technology?
---###6. Governance: voice, community guidelines, and community management

Network governance – this concept may sound dull, but it is an important aspect of online communities. You and your participants will need to make decisions about what tone of voice to foster in the network; what boundaries to implement via community guidelines; and, how to stimulate, moderate, and nurture the network using community management techniques.
Different projects will have different governance considerations. These might be based on financial or human resources, or cultural appropriateness.
Make decisions based on a realistic assessment of how much energy you and your participants have for network governance. This will help manage the expectations of all the project stakeholders. And remember ... “governance does not suck” (Bacon 2009, p213).**An example might be:**
Community artist Shonagh is about to build a password protected online network, she hopes will become a permanent resource for the community she is working with. Shonagh facilitates a series of meetings with her project’s steering committee to discuss how the network will be governed. Fortunately, all the stakeholders see the ongoing success of the network reliant on a part-time community manager, and they commit to funding the role. The group also agrees that the community guidelines will be developed once the community manager has been appointed.
**Questions to ask yourself:**1. What tone should the network have?2. How should the community guidelines be configured?3. How will the network be managed? Who will manage the network?---
###Open Conclusion
Deploying Internet technologies and practices in a community arts context, involves a survey of what is appropriate for a given project. This process requires practitioners to think broadly about experiences of technology, to readjust their practices, improvise, and create or dismantle boundaries.
This booklet‘s approach to online community building as a creative activity involving a conceptual inquiry, guides practitioners beyond existing or dominant ways of thinking, helping them preempt issues and articulate appropriate approaches - the lasting effect of this method being that practitioners become more willing to reflect on their actions and motivations, and more open to designing collaborative systems that are “an artful fit between technique, tool, human, moral, and environmental limits” (Drengson 1982).
