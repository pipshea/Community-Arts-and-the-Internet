##Community Arts & the Internet Field Guides

####Created by [Pip Shea](http://www.pipshea.com) + Inspired by [CuriousWorks](http://www.curiousworks.com.au)


**Community Arts and the Internet Field Guides** were developed to nurture critical internet practices among grassroots culture-makers. They were originally published as free PDFs, but will now be available here. I am hoping this will make it easier for **people/machines to modify/mutate the ideas/content.**

Pitched at community artists, cultural development workers, and educators, the guides explore the idea that being a critical cultural producer in the internet era involves more than learning software and making content â€“ it demands an understanding of how to contribute and respond to emergent modes of participation and connection. The guides outline conceptual and practical ideas to use as critical points of departure in projects that involve the Internet and other digital communications networks.
Community Arts & the Internet Field Guides are the work of [Pip Shea](http://www.pipshea.com) and formed part of her PhD inquiry. They were inspired during a period of fieldwork at [CuriousWorks](http://www.curiousworks.com.au), an Australian organisation whose practices lie at the intersection of emergent network technologies and creative learning.
The original booklets were created with the support of the [Queensland University of Technology](http://www.qut.edu.au) and the [ARC Centre of Excellence for Creative Industries and Innovation](http://www.cci.edu.au).
