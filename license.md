Community Arts & the Internet Field Guides are the work of [Pip Shea](http://www.pipshea.com) and formed part of her PhD inquiry. They were inspired during a period of fieldwork at [CuriousWorks](http://www.curiousworks.com.au), an Australian organisation whose practices lie at the intersection of emergent network technologies and creative learning.###Links to Original PDF booklets
